# LME Trade Request Generator

This repository contains a small web application that helps build standardized text for London Metal Exchange (LME) trade requests. It is a single page built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.
Tailwind is bundled locally as `tailwind.min.css`, so the interface works without a network connection after the first visit.

## Running the app

Because the page registers a service worker, it needs to be served over HTTP. You can use any simple static server. The repository includes an npm script for convenience:

```bash
npm start
```

This command launches `http-server` on port 8000. If you prefer you can use any other static server. Examples:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000
# or using Node
npx http-server -p 8000
```

After the server starts, open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in a modern browser.
Make sure to visit the full path to `index.html` (not just `/`) because the service worker only caches that file.

### Input validation

Enter quantities as finite positive numbers. Values of zero or negative amounts
will trigger an error message.

## Building

No build step is required. The repository only contains static files (`index.html`, `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js`). If you modify the code you simply refresh the browser to see the changes.

## Service worker

`service-worker.js` caches the essential files (`index.html`, `main.js`, `calendar-utils.js`, `solarlunar.min.js`, `tailwind.min.css` and the service worker itself) when the app is installed. This lets the app continue working offline after the first visit.

The worker uses a `CACHE_VERSION` constant to build a cache name (`lme-cache-v<version>`). Increment this value during a release so clients fetch the updated files. The activation step deletes any caches that don't match this name. During installation it also verifies that all core files were cached successfully.

After increasing `CACHE_VERSION`, refresh the site so the new worker can take control and clear the previous cache.

### Icons
`manifest.json` references icons stored in `images/`. These PNG files are cached by the service worker and managed via Git LFS.
## Holiday data

`main.js` includes UK bank holiday dates for 2025 and 2026. When the page loads it also fetches current dates from the [GOV.UK Bank Holidays API](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json) and merges them with the built‑in list. This allows the app to work with future years while still functioning offline.

To update the embedded years manually, download the JSON file above, extract the dates for the required year and append them to the `lmeHolidays` object in `main.js`.

## Prerequisites

- A modern browser that supports service workers.
- Any local HTTP server (Python 3, Node.js, etc.) if you want to run it locally.

## Running tests

Install dependencies once and run the test suite with npm:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
